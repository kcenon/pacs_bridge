# Unit Tests Directory
# Contains unit tests for individual components.
#
# Unit tests should:
# - Test single classes/functions in isolation
# - Use mocks for external dependencies
# - Run quickly (< 1 second per test)
# - Have no external dependencies (network, filesystem, etc.)
#
# Test naming convention: <module>_<component>_test.cpp
# Example: hl7_parser_test.cpp, fhir_resource_test.cpp

# Unit test sources will be added as modules are implemented
set(UNIT_TEST_SOURCES
    # Placeholder - tests pending
)
